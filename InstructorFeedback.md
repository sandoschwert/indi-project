### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Sandi, your IT Careers Web/Badge application sounds like it will nicely meet the individual project requirements and provide a good design and programming challenge, while being a very useful application! 

* Consider switching the problem statement from a .txt file to a .md file for prettier viewing in GitHub. I'm thinking of prospective employers looking at your repository, although I know you already have a job :) 

* You have a very good start to your dev schedule. Next, I'd like to see specific tasks added to complete your project. For example: ui design, database design, class design, application flow diagrams, etc.  Also be sure to include tasks for your weekly blog/wiki/status report.

You have such a wide range of skills that will all come together in this app; I'm really looking forward to seeing the process and the final product!
