Rewatched all course videos from weeks 1-4

Completed JUnitDemo exercises -- finally got JUnit configured correctly.  Shouldn't have been that hard - user error was culprit.

Started watching week 5 course videos and configuring mySQL -- again.  Should be easier the second time around

Started adding JUnit tests to group project.

Started drawing out project flow diagram for individual project
